                <h6>Last Revised: July 1, 2018</h6>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-theme">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">When you register with Sendplex online, or purchase services through our website, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information such as your name, home address, email address, birth date and telephone number(s), so that we may confirm your identity, do business with you, and notify you of updates and offers from Sendplex. For our customers, you will in addition be asked to provide your credit card number and billing information.
                <br><br>
                Some of the services on our site are available without our collection of any personally identifiable information from you at all. Still, some information may be automatically collected by our web servers as you browse our site. Our web server automatically collects information known as “clickstream data," such as the domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times and other relevant statistics. We and our web service partner companies use this information in the aggregate to measure the use of our site and to administer and improve our site.
                <br><br>
                We also collect information by using technologies and methodologies that enable tracking. The tracking information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">2. HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Sendplex uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions and to respond to your requests. The information collected is used to notify you of promotions or special offers, and to send you e-mail updates and newsletters.
                <br><br>
                When we collect personally identifiable information, we may extract some of the information and combine it with other information, such as clickstream data. This combined information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. None of this combined information is reviewed at an individual level.
                <br><br>
                We do not sell or release your personally identifiable information to anyone outside of our company and its agents, with two exceptions. First, to the extent permitted by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities pursuant to a legal request, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process. Second, we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to perform charge verifications, report or collect debts owed, or protect the rights or property of Sendplex, our customers, our website, or its users.
                <br><br>
                We also use “cookies" to provide visitors a personalized experience on our site. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to the hard drive of a visitor’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our site and to better tailor our site to our visitors’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors meet the criteria required to process their requests. Most browsers used by visitors have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent, but setting a browser to reject cookies will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site.
                <br><br>
                Sendplex uses other technologies and methodologies to help manage online advertising. These technologies are provided by our ad management partners and enable our ad management partners to recognize a unique cookie, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The unique cookie, if it exists on your computer, was placed there either by us or by another advertiser who works with our ad management partners. The information that we collect and share through the use of these technologies is anonymous and is used only to study advertising trends and effectiveness.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">3. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Sendplex does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personally identifiable information of any kind whatsoever. If a child provides us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us by sending an e-mail to:[email protected]</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">4. HOW IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ONLINE PROTECTED?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">We take reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures. When you voluntarily provide us with information while registering with us, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card information, your information is encrypted and transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) connection, available on most browsers. The padlock icon found in most browsers will appear locked and the first characters of the website address will change from “http" to “https" if you are accessing a secure server. You should take care using e-mail to send personally identifiable information to us, however, as e-mail travels unencrypted and can be read by anyone who receives or intercepts it. Once your information reaches us, we store it behind a secure firewall that blocks access to the information from outside of our network. Only Sendplex-authorized individuals are allowed to access the information.</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">5. HOW CAN YOU ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">You can access and edit any of the personally identifiable information you’ve provided to us by logging in to your Sendplex dashboard and clicking on ACCOUNT > MY PROFILE.</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">6. HOW CAN YOU OPT OUT OF MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS FROM US?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">While most of our visitors appreciate the services that registration on this site allows us to provide, we respect the right of each visitor to control how his or her personally identifiable information is used. If you do not wish to receive communications about special offers or programs from us, you can opt out in your dashboard by visiting ACCOUNT > MY PROFILE. Additionally, you can opt out of receiving such communications from us at any time by clicking on a link provided at the bottom of the e-mail communication or by e-mailing us at: [email protected]</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">7. DOES THIS POLICY COVER OTHER SITES LINKED FROM SENDPLEX?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">In order to assist you and provide you as much information as possible, our site contains links to other websites including those that offer services and branded Sendplex merchandise. These other sites, are not covered by this privacy policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites.</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">8. IN THE EVENT OF A CORPORATE CHANGE IN CONTROL, WHAT HAPPENS?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Should there be a corporate change in control, through merger, acquisition or bankruptcy, you will be given an opportunity to decide whether your information may be used by the new party-in-control of Sendplex.</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">9. WHAT ABOUT CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">By using our site you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this policy. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy and related business practices at any time by posting updated text on this site, and your continued use constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
                <h4 class="text-theme">10. WHAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">If you have any questions about this privacy policy, Sendplex’s privacy practices, the practices of this website, or your dealings with this website, please contact [email protected]</p>
